## About The Teacher
- Poor English skills
- Poor C# skills
- Small vocabulary
- Unnecessary Duplicated explanations
- Nice PowerPoints and diagrams
- Bad Time Management

Sometimes he writes some codes that are completely useless, or he is wrong by the explanations.
The course should have been a lot shorter.  
You wont be a Microservices Developer just using this course, I had to read some articles to answer my unanswered questions and complete my knowledge.

## About The Course
- Awful subtitle
- Horrible flow for the reference project
- He didn't teach all the mentioned topics in the intro video
- Ununderstandable explanations for `RabbitMQ`

He didn't teach some mentioned topics in intro video, instead he created a new course in Udemy and said use that one. And if he teach them in this course I bet it lasted forever.  
The project had a lot of unhandled exceptions.
